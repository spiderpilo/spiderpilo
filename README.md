# hey, piolo here.

I’m a Computer Science student at California State University, Long Beach, with a declared focus on AI/ML. I build full-stack web applications with an emphasis on clean UI, thoughtful design, and solving real-world problems. Recently, I’ve been exploring how AI can be used to make everyday tools more adaptive and personal.
